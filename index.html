        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Alexis A. Bahl, Ph.D., is an Instructor and Researcher, Project Coordinator in the Department of
          Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC).
          Her research examines Salpa thompsoni diel vertical migration and its influence on Southern Ocean
          ecosystem structure and function, with emphasis on active carbon transport and biogeochemical models.
          She contributes to the Integrating Climate and Ecosystems Dynamics (ICED) working group and
          coordinates early-career participation in the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and
          Modelling Project (SOCCOM). She also analyzes multi-institutional survey datasets for the Canadian
          Consortium for Science Equity Scholars, producing instructor-facing visual and analytic reports.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I come from a blue-collar, working-class family that supported me in my ambitions to attend college, all the way from a Bachelors to a Doctorate. Being the first
        of my family to receive any college degree, I navigated the ins and outs of academia purely through supportive mentors and advisors. Throughout my entire academic career, 
        I worked part-time jobs, often 2-3 at a time to afford tuition, books, and living expenses. 
        
        I am proud to have started at a Community College where my Spanish Teacher supported me to getting into Loyola University Chicago. I entered Loyola majoring in pre-med with the intention of studying
        sports medicine. Upon taking my first Environmental Science elective course I was introduced to the study of Earth Sciences and I fell in love. I changed my major and 
        advanced through my courses, all the while teaching myself about marine science - a course and content I did not have available at my mid-western university. I traveled and
        volunterred to gain perspective, experience, and insight into what a career in marine science would look like. 
        
        Upon graduating with my Bsc in Environmental Science, I applied to graduate schools and was accepted to Johns Hopkins University for their Environmental Sciences and Policy MSc program. 
        When I traveled to Borneo during my undergrad I was exposed to the realities of climate change and it's disproportionate effects on vulnerable communities. I wanted to learn more about the science behind climate change
        and how policy can be shaped to mitigate its effects. During my MSc I worked as a research assistant analyzing Earth System Models to understand ocean biogeochemical response to increased CO2.
        After graduating with my MSc, I applied to PhD programs in Oceanography and was accepted to UBC. Here, I have been able to combine my interests in marine science and climate change, focusing my research on the Southern Ocean's 
        biological carbon pump and how it may be affected by climate change. My focus has never never steered from conducting research for the purpose of informing policy and management decisions.
